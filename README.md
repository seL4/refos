RefOS Repository
================

This is the git repository for RefOS.
This repository is meant to be used as part of a Google repo setup. Instead of cloning it directly,
please go to the following repository and follow the instructions there:

    https://github.com/seL4/refos-manifest

RefOS is currently supported on iMX3.1 KZM, iMX6 Sabre Lite and ia32 hardware platforms and
on qemu-ARM kzm and qemu-i386 ia32.

Overview
--------

The repository is organised as follows.

 * [`impl/apps`](impl/apps/): RefOS system and userland applications
    * [`selfloader`](impl/apps/selfloader/): Bootstrap application, which is responsible for starting
      user processes.
    * [`process_server`](impl/apps/process_server/): The process server, which runs as the root
      task and provides process and thread abstraction and initialises the entire system.
    * [`file_server`](impl/apps/file_server/): The cpio file server, which stores files and
      executables in a cpio archive and exposes them via a dataspace interface.
    * [`console_server`](impl/apps/console_server/): The console server, a system process which acts
      as the console device driver and manages serial input and output and EGA text mode output.
    * [`timer_server`](impl/apps/timer_server/): The timer server, a userland driver process which
      manages the timer device and provides timer get time and sleep functionality.
    * [`terminal`](impl/apps/terminal/): The interactive terminal application.
    * [`test_os`](impl/apps/test_os/): RefOS operating system level test suite, which tests the
      operating system environment.
    * [`test_user`](impl/apps/test_os/): RefOS user-level test application, which is responsible for
      testing the operating system user environment.
    * [`snake`](impl/apps/snake/): Example snake game.
    * [`tetris`](impl/apps/tetris/): Example tetris game.
    * [`nethack`](impl/apps/nethack/): Port of Nethack 3.4.3 roguelike game.
 * [`impl/libs`](impl/libs/): RefOS system and userland applications
    * [`libdatastruct`](impl/libs/libdatastruct/): RefOS library that provides simple C data structures such as
      vectors, hash tables and allocation tables.
    * [`librefos`](impl/libs/librefos/): RefOS user and server shared definitions, RPC specifications and
      generated stubs and low level helper libraries.
    * [`librefossys`](impl/libs/librefossys/): RefOS library that implements some POSIX system calls using low-level
      RefOS and thus allows the C library to work. This directory is intended to simplify RefOS
      userland applications and facilitate porting.
 * [`impl/docs`](impl/docs/): RefOS doxygen code documentation.
 * [`design`](design/): RefOS protocol design document.

Suggested Future Work
---------------------

The following is suggested future work that interested open-source developers could implement:

 * Future Work 1: modify how the process server creates and starts processes and threads (see 'Future Work 1' in code)
 * Future Work 2: fix issue where calls to assert_fail() result in infinite recursion on x86 architecture (see 'Future Work 2' in code)
 * Future Work 3: modify how the selfloader bootstraps user processes (see 'Future Work 3' in code)
 * Future Work 4: remove explicit reference to system call table in processes that the process server creates (see 'Future Work 4' in code)
 * Future Work 5: set up muslc's errno in RefOS (see 'Future Work 5' in code)
 * Future Work 6: get ia32_screen_debug_defconfig and ia32_screen_release_defconfig default configurations running with new seL4 API
 * Future Work 7: get Nethack running with new seL4 API
