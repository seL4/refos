        Syscall library for RefOS  userland. This library is responsible for implementing simple
        POSIX environment syscalls on top of RefOS primitives. This allows for the C standard
        library to work and be happy, and also allows for easier porting.

config REFOS_SYS_FORCE_DEBUGPUTCHAR
    bool "Force seL4_DebugPutChar printf"
    default n
    depends on LIB_REFOS_SYS
    help
        Force RefOS userland to use seL4_DebugPutChar(), even when not needed. If this option is not
        set, IPC messages will be sent to the Console server. This allows a few more messages to
        print during initialisation, useful for debugging. Requires seL4 debug kernel.
