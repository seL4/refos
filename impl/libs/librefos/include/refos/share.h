    @brief RefOS sharing library.
    
    Helper ring buffer library which can be used to implement sharing. For details on how sharing
    is done on RefOS, please refer to the protocol documentation. Uses a standard ringbuffer
    implementation.
    
    Assumes that the sharing has already been set up, and mapped into windows on both processes.
