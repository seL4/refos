    help
        RefOS Process Server application, which runs as the initial root task of the
        entire system. The process server is a trusted component; its responsible for starting
        and managing processes and threads, and hands the right capabilities to the right processes.
        The process server is required for the system to start.

config PROCSERV_INITIAL_MEM_SIZE
    int "Initial memory pool size"
    default 196608
    depends on APP_PROCESS_SERVER
    help
        Initial process server allocator memory pool. In order to solve cyclic allocation dependency
        problems, the allocator requires a static pre-allocated pool of memory in order to function.
        If this is set too high, too much memory will be reserved for book keeping and not enough
        RAM is left to be used to useful stuff. If this is set too low, the allocator runs out of
        memory to book keep the allocated objects, and starts failing object allocation before all
        the available RAM is used up.

config PROCSERV_MAX_VSPACES
    int "Max number of available page directories."
    default 64
    depends on APP_PROCESS_SERVER
    help
        Number of available statically allocated page directory objects. This is done to avoid
        allocator fragmentation, as kernel PD objects are quite big. They can easily fail to
        allocate if allocated dynamically. This number inheritly also limits the maximum number of
        processes available at once in the system. The actual number of processes available is
        MIN(PROCSERV_MAX_VSPACES, PROCSERV_MAX_PROCESSES).
