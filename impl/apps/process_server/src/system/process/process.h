    @brief Process management module for process server.

    Module which manages everything to do with a process and its threads; provides a basic process
    interface, handling the virtual memory address spaces, kernel objects, ELF-loading....etc. The
    sel4utils library is used here to easily implement direct booting of executables. The process
    server needs to be able to directly boot the system executables needed for the selfloader
    to function. The selfloader app then takes over the job of ELF-loading RefOS user-land apps
    once the system is up and running.

    Executable files are stored on the process server's own CPIO archive.
