    @brief Ring buffer implementation, operating on the internal RAM dataspace objects.

    A simple <b>MCRingBuffer</b> implementation which operates on the internal RAM dataspaces. This
    is designed for communication with the clients who share to us our own dataspace. Since reading
    from a page entry is computationally expensive as it requires mapping the frame, copying the
    data out and then unmapping the frame, the MCRingBuffer algorithm is used here to minimise the
    frequency of read / writes to the shared control variables.

    A structure containing information regarding to a single ring buffer. Does NOT take ownership of
    the associated dataspace; merely provides a wrapping to use ringbuffers on top of a struct
    ram_dataspace. Ringbuffers are uni-directional; either read-only or write-only, as described in
    rb_modes_t.

    The structure also shares ownership of the underlying dataspace object, using a shared
    reference. This ensures that the ram_dspace structure pointed here is always valid, but also
    means this rb_buffer must be deleted for the linked ram_dspace to be truly deleted, as this
    object "hangs onto" its dataspace.
