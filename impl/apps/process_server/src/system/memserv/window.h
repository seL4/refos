    @brief Manages and keeps track of memory windows.

    \image html memwindow.png

    In RefOS, memory segment windows (just called windows for short), are virtual address  <a href =
    'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_segmentation'>memory segments</a> which belong in clients'
    vspaces. Each window keeps track of its read / write permissions, cachability, mapped contents,
    and any other state about the memory segment, and are represented by badged procserv endpoint
    capabilities. A window represents the permission to handle and map memory into a segment of a
    client's virtual address space.

    This module manages and keeps track of client memory window segments and their associations.
    Used to implement the memory window segment interface. Each window is assigned a unique
    windowID, dynamically allocated.

    Note that when operating on client memory windows, the higher-level vs_*
    window functions in <addrspace/vspace.h> should be used instead of the functions here. This
    module simply provides the low-level management functions for global window lists and window
    associations, does not provide any vspace functionality underneath.
