/*! @file
    @brief Static page directory allocator.

    Pre-allocates a static array of PDs, and provides interface to allocate and reuse them as
    needed. This is done to avoid fragmentation as kernel PD objects are quite big. Also manages
    root CNodes objects associated with the PDs address spaces, as they are quite big and also cause
    fragmentation.

    This module has ownership of the underlying PDs and CNodes, and will manage their creation /
    deletion. Uses a free-list internally to bookkeep re-assignment of previously deleted PDs.
